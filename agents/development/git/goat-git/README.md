# goat-git

## What it does
- Provides an opinionated, production-minded instruction set for git work.
- Prefers minimal complexity and clear output contracts.

## What it does not do
- It will not intentionally generate insecure-by-design or collaboration-hostile practices.
- It will not assume hidden repo settings, secrets, or permissions without stating assumptions.
